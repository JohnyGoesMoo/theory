The program begins by opening a file containing words and reading its entire content.
The content is split into a list of words, with each word separated by a newline character.
The total number of words in the list is calculated.
slovicka = open("fiel.txt", 'r', encoding="UTF-8").read() slovicka = slovicka.split('\n')  # split into list based on enters pocet_slov = len(slovicka)  # number of words # select a language sjl_anj = input("zadaj jazyk sjl/anj: ")
The user is prompted to input a language code (`sjl` for Slovak or `anj` for English).
Based on the user's input, the index `i` is set to `0` for Slovak or `1` for English. This index will be used to determine which words to prompt for translation.
uhadnute = []  # list to hold correctly guessed words neuhadnute = 0  # incorrect i = 0 if sjl_anj == "sjl" else 1  # starting index on selected language

# loop until half is correct guess while len(uhadnute) < pocet_slov // 2: # prompt to translate slovo = input(f"preloz {slovicka[i % len(slovicka)]}: ")
    # Check if the current index is even (sjl) or odd (anj)     if i % 2 == 0:
        # if the translation matches   The program enters a loop that continues until the user correctly guesses half of the words.
# Within the loop, the user is prompted to translate a word based on the current index `i`.     if slovicka[(i + 1) % len(slovicka)] == slovo:uhadnute.append(slovo)  # Add the correct guess to the list temp = len(slovicka)  # Get the current length of the word list slovicka.pop(i % temp)  # Remove the current word from the list
            slovicka.pop(i % temp)  # Remove the next word (its translation) from the list
        else: i += 2  # Move to the next pair of words neuhadnute += 1  # Increment the incorrect guess counter
    else:# Check if the user's translation matches the previous word in the list if slovicka[(i - 1) % len(slovicka)] == slovo: uhadnute.append(slovo)  # Add the correct guess to the list temp = len(slovicka)  # Get the current length of the word list
            If the index `i` is even, the program checks if the user's input matches the next word in the list. If correct, the word and its translation are removed from the list, and the correct guess is added to the `uhadnute` list. If incorrect, the index is incremented by 2, and the incorrect guess counter is incremented.
If the index `i` is odd, the program checks if the user's input matches the previous word in the list. If correct, the word and its translation are removed from the list, and the correct guess is added to the `uhadnute` list. If incorrect, the index is incremented by 2, and the incorrect guess counter is incremented.
This process ensures that words are checked in pairs and alternates between languages as needed.slovicka.pop(i % temp)  # Remove the current word from the list slovicka.pop((i - 1) % temp)  # Remove the previous word (its translation) from the list print(slovicka)  # Print the updated word list
        else:i += 2  # Move to the next pair of wordsneuhadnute += 1  # Increment the incorrect guess counter

# Print the number of incorrect attempts print("zle pokusy:", neuhadnute)








Once the user has correctly guessed half of the words, the loop ends.
The program prints the total number of incorrect attempts made by the user.
