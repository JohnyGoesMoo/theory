The code opens a file containing transportation survey data.
It reads each line, splits it by semicolon, and converts the numerical values to integers.
The processed data is stored in a list called `data`.
fr = open("file.txt", 'r', encoding="UTF-8").readlines()

# Initialize an empty list to store transportation data data = []

# Iterate over each line in the file for i in fr:     # Print each line for debugging     print(i)     # Split the line by semicolon to extract data
    temp = i.strip().split(';')     # Convert the first two elements to integers     temp[0], temp[1] = int(temp[0]), int(temp[1])  # Append the processed data to the 'data' list     data.append(temp)

# Define capacity thresholds for tram cars dlha = 200       # Long tram standartna = 100 # Standard tram kratka = 50      # Short tram
The script iterates over each transportation data entry to simulate tram passenger counts at each station.
It tracks the maximum number of passengers and updates the current passenger count accordingly.
Stations are categorized based on tram capacity requirements for ticket vending machines and signals.

The script determines the appropriate tram type (short, standard, or long) based on the maximum passenger count observed.
