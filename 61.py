`tkinter` is imported for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
Initializes a dictionary `odtiene` to count occurrences of each possible shade (0-255).
Loops through the pixel data, converting each pair of hexadecimal characters to an integer.
Counts how many times each shade appears in the pixel data.
import tkinter as tk  # Import the tkinter module for creating GUI applications


def shades_of_gray(pixels):
    shades = {i: 0 for i in range(256)}  # Idict to count each shade(0-255)  for i in pixels:  # each pix for j in range(0, len(i), 2):  # each character in line, 2 at a time
            pixel = int(i[j] + i[j + 1], 16)  # 2char hexadecimal into a string shades[pixel] += 1  # count for koresponding shade new_shades = {}  # store only non zero counts for i in shades.keys():  # each shade in the dict
        if shades[i] != 0:  # if count not 0 new_shades[i] = shades[i]  # add to new dict return new_shades
Creates a new dictionary `new_odtiene` to store only the shades with non-zero counts.

Initializes the x-coordinate for drawing the histogram.
Loops through the dictionary of shades and their counts.
def hist(shades):
    x = 0  # coord for drawing from beginning for i in shades:  # each shade y = HEIGHT - int(shades[i] / max * HEIGHT)  # y based on count # rect represent the count
        canvas.create_rectangle(x, HEIGHT, x + 1, y, fill="grey", outline='grey')  x += 2  # move to next shade

fr = open("file.txt", 'r', encoding="UTF-8")
dimensions = fr.readline().strip().split()  # get dimensions x, y = int(dimensions[0]), int(dimensions[1])  # to integers  print(f"sirka: {x}\nvyska: {y}\npocet bodov: {x*y}")  # dim, total pix count
Calculates the height of each bar in the histogram based on the count of the shade.
Draws a rectangle for each shade to represent its count.

Opens the file containing the image data and reads the dimensions from the first line.
Prints the dimensions and the total number of pixels.
pixels = fr.readlines()  pixels = [i.strip() for i in pixels] root = tk.Tk()

shades = shades_of_gray(pixels)  # count shades in img max = max(shades.values())  # find max print("pocet najcastejsieho odtiena:", max)
Reads the rest of the file to get the pixel data, stripping any whitespace.
Initializes the tkinter main window.
Calls `spocitaj_odtiene` to count the shades in the image.
Finds and prints the maximum count of any shade.
Sets the dimensions of the canvas based on the number of shades and a fixed height.
Creates and packs the canvas widget.
# based on number of shades WIDTH = len(shades) * 2 HEIGHT = 500 canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=WIDTH, height=HEIGHT)  canvas.pack()

hist(shades)
root.mainloop()
Calls `nakresli_histogram` to draw the histogram on the canvas.
Starts the main loop of the tkinter application to display the window.
