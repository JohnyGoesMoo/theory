The code starts by opening the file  in read mode with UTF-8 encoding. The `readlines()` method is used to read all lines from the file into a list called `text`.
An empty dictionary `data` is initialized to store the athletes' names and their times.
The code then iterates through each line in the `text` list. For each line, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace and splits the line into two parts: the athlete's name and their completion time.
text = open("file.txt", 'r', encoding="UTF-8").readlines() data = {} #names and times dict for i in text: temp = i.strip().split() #split name time data[temp[0]] = int(temp[1]) #name=key, time=int=value in dict
The athlete's name is used as a key in the `data` dictionary, and their completion time (converted to an integer) is stored as the corresponding value.

The code prints the number of athletes who participated in the competition by getting the length of the `data` dictionary using `len(data)`.
The code prints the name and completion time of each athlete using a formatted string. It iterates through the `data` dictionary and creates a formatted string for each athlete, indicating their name and the time it took for them to finish the race.
print("pocet zucastnenych sportovcov:", len(data))
print('\n'.join([f"Sutaziaci {i} dobehol do ciela za {data[i]} sekund" for i in data]))# Print the name and completion time of each athlet
winner = min(data, key=lambda x: data[x])# Determine the athlete with the minimum time (the winner)

print(f"najlepsi sutaziaci je {winner} s casom {data[winner]//60} min. {data[winner]%60} sek.")# Print the winner's name and time, formatted as minutes and seconds
he `min()` function is used to find the key (athlete's name) with the smallest value (completion time) in the `data` dictionary. The `key=lambda x: data[x]` argument ensures that the function compares the times to find the minimum.
The code prints the winner's name and their completion time, formatted as minutes and seconds. The time is converted from seconds to minutes and seconds using integer division (`//`) and modulus (`%`).
